Assumtions:
 -> Need to perfrom SELECT DISTINCT NAME on the most recent records 
 -> No indexes present
 -> No data purged in long time
 -> Table Name: TestTable
 -> Colums: key, name, create_date, status
 -> Assuming SQL RDBMS
Solution:
    -> Since there are no indexes if we perform the query most likely the entire table will be scaned which will 
    be very slow
    -> With 100 threads updating status column it can cause futher performance slowdowns

    Basic Ideas:
    -> Since I am seraching the most recent records we can filter by CREATE_DATE column to reduce the number of rows queried
    -> Also limit the number of records returned, essentially batch the result to ensure the query does not take too long to run 

    EX: 
    SELECT DISTINCT name 
    FROM test_table 
    WHERE create_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL X DAY)
    LIMIT 10000;
