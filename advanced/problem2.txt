Assumptions/Known Info:
    -> No Downtime
    -> Delete all data older than 1 month and add indexes



Solution:

Approach: Instead of trying to delete all data at once we can incrementally delete data in batches
          Attempt to perform these operation during off peak hours to minimize any impact


1. Starting from one month prior start deleting records in batches to allow other operations to continue between deletions
  -> Could do some testing prior to figure out the batch size
  -> Lets use 1000 records as the batch size

2. Add indexes simultaneously:
    CREATE INDEX idex_create_date ON Test_Table (create_date);
    CREATE INDEX idex_status ON Test_Table (status);
    CREATE INDEX idxex_name ON Test_Table (name);
